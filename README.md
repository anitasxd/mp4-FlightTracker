## Mobile Developers at Berkeley
Flight Tracker is an app that retrieves flight information from the Lufthansa airline. There are a total of 3 tab views and users can easily toggle between flights, airports, and favorite flights. Users are first prompted to search for a specific flight by inputting the flight code and date. Once successfully searched, user is able to add the flight to their favorites. Favorites displays all user favorites in a table view. Airports is a map view of all the airports in the Lufthansa system. Each annotation button leads to a more detailed page.
